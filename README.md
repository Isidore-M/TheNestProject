**🪺 The Nest**

Where ideas find their colony.
The Nest is a minimal, collaborative hub built for the modern creator. 
It’s designed to bridge the gap between "I have an idea" and "We built a team." 
No noise, just high-signal collaboration for designers and developers.

**🎨 Design Philosophy**

The UI is built on a foundation of clarity and soft-minimalism.
Type: Poppins (Bold for hierarchy, Medium for legibility).
Palette: Off-white backgrounds (#F5F5F5) paired with deep blacks and a signature Gold accent.
Feel: Tactile interactions, subtle shadows, and a "breathable" layout that stays out of the way of the content.

**🛠 Built With**

SwiftUI: Declarative UI for a fluid, reactive experience.
Firebase: Real-time data sync for a "zero-latency" feel.
Atomic Sync: Custom batch logic to handle team admissions and notifications in a single heartbeat.

**✨ The Experience**

01. Discovery

Browse a curated feed of project cards. See who's leading, what they're building, and who’s already in the colony.

02. Collaborative Profiles

Traditional resumes are boring. The Nest uses skill-based profiles that highlight your interests and portfolio links, 
making it easy to find your perfect creative match.

03. Seamless Onboarding

A frictionless, multi-step flow that gets you from "Sign Up" to "Exploring" in under 60 seconds.

**🏗 The Logic**

The app is engineered for data integrity. The TeamManager ensures that when you accept a collaborator,
the database updates are atomic—meaning your project list and notification center stay perfectly in sync, every time.
